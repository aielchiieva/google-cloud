# Google BigQuery Multi Table Sink

Description
-----------
This sink writes to a multiple BigQuery tables.
BigQuery is Google's serverless, highly scalable, enterprise data warehouse.
Data is first written to a temporary location on Google Cloud Storage, then loaded into BigQuery from there.

Credentials
-----------
If the plugin is run on a Google Cloud Dataproc cluster, the service account key does not need to be
provided and can be set to 'auto-detect'.
Credentials will be automatically read from the cluster environment.

If the plugin is not run on a Dataproc cluster, the path to a service account key must be provided.
The service account key can be found on the Dashboard in the Cloud Platform Console.
Make sure the account key has permission to access BigQuery and Google Cloud Storage.
The service account key file needs to be available on every node in your cluster and
must be readable by all users running the job.

Properties
----------
**Reference Name:** Name used to uniquely identify this sink for lineage, annotating metadata, etc.

**Project ID:** Google Cloud Project ID, which uniquely identifies a project.
It can be found on the Dashboard in the Google Cloud Platform Console. This is the project
that the BigQuery job will run in. If a temporary bucket needs to be created, the service account
must have permission in this project to create buckets.

**Dataset:** Dataset the tables belongs to. A dataset is contained within a specific project.
Datasets are top-level containers that are used to organize and control access to tables and views.
If dataset does not exist, it will be created.

**Temporary Bucket Name:** Google Cloud Storage bucket to store temporary data in.
It will be automatically created if it does not exist, but will not be automatically deleted.
Temporary data will be deleted after it is loaded into BigQuery. If it is not provided, a unique
bucket will be created and then deleted after the run finishes.

**Split Field:** The name of the field that will be used to determine which table to write to. 
Defaults to `tablename`.

**Service Account File Path:** Path on the local file system of the service account key used for
authorization. Can be set to 'auto-detect' when running on a Dataproc cluster.
When running on other clusters, the file must be present on every node in the cluster.

Example
-------

Suppose the input records are:

    +-----+----------+------------------+-----------+
    | id  | name     | email            | tablename |
    +-----+----------+------------------+-----------+
    | 0   | Samuel   | sjax@example.net | accounts  |
    | 1   | Alice    | a@example.net    | accounts  |
    +-----+----------+------------------+-----------+
    +--------+----------+--------+-----------+
    | userid | item     | action | tablename |
    +--------+----------+--------+-----------+
    | 0      | shirt123 | view   | activity  |
    | 0      | carxyz   | view   | activity  |
    | 0      | shirt123 | buy    | activity  |
    | 0      | coffee   | view   | activity  |
    | 1      | cola     | buy    | activity  |
    +--------+----------+--------+-----------+

The plugin will expect two pipeline arguments to tell it to write the first two records to an `accounts` table
and others records to an `activity` table.
